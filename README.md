Project 2: 
Investigation of a Data Breach: 
Objective: Investigation of a Data Breach on a Renowned 
Website. 
Scenario: Imagine that there has been a data breach at a 
renowned website, and your task is to investigate this breach. 
While the website's name is fictional, the scenario will test your 
investigative and forensic skills.  
Details: Company Name: ABC SecureBank, a highly reputable 
financial institution. Breach Discovery: The breach was 
discovered during a routine security audit, and it appears that 
sensitive customer data may have been exposed. Scope of 
Breach: The breach involves potential exposure of customer 
account information, including names, account numbers, and 
transaction history.  
Tasks: 1. Incident Analysis: Investigate how the breach occurred. 
Determine the point of entry, the extent of the breach, and the 
timeframe during which it occurred. 
2. Forensic Analysis: Conduct digital forensics on the affected 
systems to identify any malware or suspicious activities. Collect 
evidence and logs.  
3. Data Recovery: Determine the type and quantity of customer 
data that was potentially exposed. Develop a strategy for data 
recovery and incident containment. 
4. Regulatory Compliance: Consider the legal and regulatory 
aspects of the data breach and ensure that the company 
complies with reporting requirements. 
5. Communication and Notification: Develop a communication 
plan for notifying affected customers, stakeholders, and 
regulatory bodies. Ensure that the communication is clear and in 
compliance with privacy laws. 
6. Post-Incident Review: After the breach has been contained 
and mitigated, conduct a thorough review to identify 
weaknesses in the security posture and provide 
recommendations for improving security.  
This task will challenge your investigative and problem-solving 
skills while emphasizing the critical aspects of handling a data 
breach in a highly sensitive environment
